# Research Talk March 9th

Meta Learning is Key (Papers exist?)
Check #params between embeddings and raw
Check upper bound between raw ans embedded

Clarify the problem formulation (should include budget)
both fpr reward shaping and not

since budget is fixed, we can try gamma=1

## debugging
State space with only BvsSB only with fixed policy 

## Ideas

### Fixing the expensive interactions with the environment
Using DynaV to simulate trajectories to generate more training data per environment interaction
